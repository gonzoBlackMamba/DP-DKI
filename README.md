Double-pulsed Diffusional Kurtosis Imaging (DP-DKI) analysis script
---

Here, we implement the DP-DKI analysis for Moss et al. Linear Rotationally Invariant Kurtosis Measures from Double Diffusion Encoding MRI, MRI (2025). This work aims to characterize the complete set of linear rotationally invariant kurtosis measures provided by double diffusion encoding MRI. It also shows their utility in distinguishing different types of multiple Gaussian compartment (MGC) models. Last, it demonstrates a simplified acquisition and analysis shcheme for esimation of the rotational invariants.

This software requires python versions >= 3.9 and provides both pre-processing using MRTrix3 and the analysis code for the rotational invariants. 

To do:
1. Split this code into modules for ease of use.
2. Provide example data and analysis steps with output maps.
