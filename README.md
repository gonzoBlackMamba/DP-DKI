Double pulsed DKI analysis script
---

Jens had a brilliant idea that we implimented here to analyze double pulsed DKI (DP-DKI). This also allowed us to get more independent measures from the kurtosis tensors as well as an estimate of the exchange rate (albeit crude). 

It was sent in for review, returned, now on the back-burner.

NEED TO:

1. Find Sune's paper to translate their microFA and other notation into our notation.
2. Recode up their microFA parameter in our notation and show how ours is less sensitive to exchange wherears there's is highly dependent upon exchange.
