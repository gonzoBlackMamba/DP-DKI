Double pulsed DKI analysis script
---

Here, we implement Jens' way to analyze double pulsed DKI (DP-DKI) data. Aside from additional raotational invariants related to the kurtosis tensor(s), we also geta crude estimate of the exchange rate (albeit crude). 

Manuscript is currently in limbo (as of 2/21/24).

NEED TO:

1. Find Sune's paper to translate their microFA and other notation into our notation.
2. Recode up their microFA parameter in our notation and show how ours is less sensitive to exchange wherears there's is highly dependent upon exchange.

Update (2/21/24): sending the code (written for nifti files) to Jayce to modify to the Bruker 7T animal scanner data format.

Coded and tested by Hunter Moss.
